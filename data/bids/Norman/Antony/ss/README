bball dataset: fMRI data of naturalistic basketball watching

The 'bball' dataset includes 20 subjects watching the last 5 minutes of 9 NCAA games from the 2012 men's NCAA basketball ("March Madness") tournament. Data were collected from May to September 2019. The published study investigated behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates with the construct of surprise - defined here as changes in the likelihood of winning between two teams.
